Hi, I'm an iOS Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience, focused on delivering scalable and easy-to-maintain applications with high code coverage.

I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm working with Swift and Dart(Flutter).

I love to create example applications to study and help other developers, taking advantage of applying new patterns and technologies.
